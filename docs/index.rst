Welcome To Dooku
================

Dooku is a set of libraries for the Python programming language that provides
various useful stuff that you might need in everyday usage. The idea is
to provide a set of libraries and useful functions, just like Boost does
in C++ world.

It's a good not only as a set of libraries, it also may be used as a some
kind of incubator where various developers can test and evolve their
projects. So please don't hesitate to propose your library to be a part
of Dooku.

The library is self-contained and there are no dependencies it requires.
Just install it with ``pip`` and enjoy!

.. code:: bash

    $ [sudo] pip install dooku
